# Overview
Maxwell is a strongly-typed, header-only, dimensional analysis library for C++20. It performs dimensional analysis, including verification of dimensional coherence and calculation of unit conversion factors, at compile-time with no run-time overhead.

The library consists of one main header file, [Maxwell.hpp](include/Maxwell.hpp) and a library of unit tests. Additionally, several examples showing how to use Maxwell are provided.
