# Introduction
Maxwell is a strongly typed units library for C++ 20. It enables checking of units at compile-time 
as well as conversion of units at compile-time. This ensures that if your program compiles, your dimensional analysis is correct and all unit conversions have automatically been performed. Because all of the conversions are calculated at compile-time, there is very little run-time overhead to using this library.
