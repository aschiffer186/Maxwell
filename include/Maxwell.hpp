/// \mainpage Maxwell
///
/// This documentation guide provides a reference of the Maxwell library. Most of the descriptions are
/// provided in the same format as the method of description of the C++ 20 standard library (see
/// [clause 16.3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf)). However, additional description
/// has been added for more casual users of Maxwell.
///
///  The following definitions are used to define the types and functions in Maxwell:
///   - _Constraints_ has the same defintion as _constraints_ in the C++ 20 standard (see
///   [clause 16.3.2.4](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf)).
///   - _Mandates_ has the same defintion as _mandates_ in the C++ 20 standard (see
///   [clause 16.3.2.4](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf)).
///   - _Effects_ has the same definition as _effects_ in the C++ 20 standard (see
///   [clause 16.3.2.4](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf)).
///   - _Remarks_ has the same definition as _remarks_ in the C++ 20 standard (see
///   [clause 16.3.2.4](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/n4928.pdf)).
